Scalable Vector Graphics. This creates a single SVG file, without
embedded fonts, for every page of output. It is recommended to install
the Century Schoolbook fonts, included with your LilyPond
installation, for optimal rendering. Under UNIX, simply copy these
fonts from the LilyPond directory (typically
‘/usr/share/lilypond/VERSION/fonts/otf/’) to ‘~/.fonts/’. The SVG
output should be compatible with any SVG editor or user agent. There
is also an option svg-woff (below) for use of woff font files in the
SVG backend.

svg-woff	#f	Use woff font files in SVG backend.
